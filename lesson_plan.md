# Cambridge Primary Mathematics – Stage 2 Lesson Plan
## Bridging Unit 9 (Inverse Relationships) → Unit 10 (Introduction to Multiplication)

| **Date** | Tomorrow (see curriculum calendar) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Duration** | 60 minutes |
| **Year Level** | Year 2 (approximately 7 years old) |
| **Resources** | Counters, mini whiteboards, fact family cards, array grids |

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. **Identify fact families** for addition/subtraction and multiplication/division
2. **Explain inverse relationships** – how we can "undo" a calculation
3. **Convert repeated addition** (e.g., 5 + 5 + 5) into multiplication (3 × 5)
4. **Connect doubling** to the 2-times table

---

## Warm-Up: Fact Family Fast-Fire (8 minutes)

> **Teacher Script:** "Good morning, mathematicians! Today we're going to discover something magical about numbers – they have FAMILIES! Let's see how fast you can find all the family members!"

### Activity Instructions

1. Display three numbers on the board: **15, 10, 5**
2. Challenge students to write **all 4 related equations** on mini whiteboards
3. Give 60 seconds, then reveal answers together

**Expected Answers:**
- 10 + 5 = 15
- 5 + 10 = 15
- 15 − 5 = 10
- 15 − 10 = 5

### Transition to Multiplication/Division

> **Teacher Script:** "Fantastic work! Now here's something exciting – multiplication and division have fact families too!"

Display new numbers: **2, 5, 10**

**Expected Answers:**
- 2 × 5 = 10
- 5 × 2 = 10
- 10 ÷ 2 = 5
- 10 ÷ 5 = 2

> **Teacher Script:** "See how the same three numbers create four equations? This is the power of INVERSE operations!"

## Direct Instruction (15 minutes)

### Part A: The Inverse Equation Concept (5 mins)

> **Teacher Script:** "Inverse means OPPOSITE. Just like walking forward and then walking backward gets you back to where you started, we can UNDO calculations!"

**Demonstrate on board:**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Start with 8 | 8 |
| Add 7 | 8 + 7 = **15** |
| Subtract 7 (UNDO) | 15 − 7 = **8** ✓ Back to start! |

> **Key Point:** "Subtraction undoes addition. Division undoes multiplication."

### Part B: Repeated Addition → Multiplication (5 mins)

> **Teacher Script:** "Now let's discover why multiplication is like a SHORTCUT!"

**Write on board:**
```
5 + 5 + 5 = 15

How many fives? THREE!
So we can write: 3 × 5 = 15
```

**Practice together:**
- 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = ? → **4 × 2 = 8**
- 10 + 10 + 10 = ? → **3 × 10 = 30**

> **Teacher Script:** "Instead of adding the same number over and over, multiplication lets us do it in ONE step!"

### Part C: Doubling = The 2× Table (5 mins)

> **Teacher Script:** "When we DOUBLE a number, we're actually using the 2-times table!"

**Interactive demonstration:**

| Number | Double | 2× Table |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 3 | 3 + 3 = 6 | 2 × 3 = 6 ✓ |
| 5 | 5 + 5 = 10 | 2 × 5 = 10 ✓ |
| 7 | 7 + 7 = 14 | 2 × 7 = 14 ✓ |

> **Key Point:** "Double means TWO of something – that's 2 times!"

---

## Guided Practice: Word Problems (10 minutes)

> **Teacher Script:** "Now let's use our fact family skills to solve some puzzles!"

### Problem 1: Missing Factor
> "There are 10 stickers shared equally between 2 children. How many stickers does each child get?"
>
> **Equation:** ☐ × 2 = 10
>
> **Fact Family Help:** If 2 × 5 = 10, then 10 ÷ 2 = **5**

### Problem 2: Missing Product
> "Princess Luna has 4 bags with 5 gems in each bag. How many gems does she have altogether?"
>
> **Equation:** 4 × 5 = ☐
>
> **Repeated Addition:** 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **20**

### Problem 3: Inverse Check
> "If 3 × 2 = 6, what is 6 ÷ 2?"
>
> **Same fact family!** The answer is **3**

## Hands-On Activity: Array Builders (15 minutes)

> **Teacher Script:** "Time to BUILD our multiplication with counters!"

### Activity Setup
- Distribute 20 counters per pair/group
- Provide array grid mats (optional)

### Instructions

**Step 1: Build the Array**
> "Make 3 rows with 5 counters in each row."

```
● ● ● ● ●
● ● ● ● ●
● ● ● ● ●
```

**Step 2: Count and Write**
> "How many altogether? Write it as repeated addition AND multiplication!"
- 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
- 3 × 5 = 15

**Step 3: Rotate the Array**
> "Now turn your array! What do you see?"

```
● ● ●
● ● ●
● ● ●
● ● ●
● ● ●
```

> "It's now 5 rows of 3! Write the NEW multiplication!"
- 5 × 3 = 15

> **Key Discovery:** "3 × 5 = 5 × 3 – The answer stays the same!"

### Extension Challenges
- Build 2 × 4, then write the fact family
- Build 4 × 5, find all 4 related equations

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### 🌱 Support (for students needing additional help)
- Provide pre-made array cards for visual reference
- Use concrete manipulatives throughout (no abstract numbers only)
- Partner with a peer for the array activity
- Focus only on the 2× table initially
- Provide number line for counting jumps

### 🚀 Challenge (for advanced learners)
**Table Connections Investigation:**
> "Can you find the SECRET relationship between the 2×, 5×, and 10× tables?"

| 2× Table | 5× Table | 10× Table |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 2 × 1 = 2 | 5 × 1 = 5 | 10 × 1 = 10 |
| 2 × 2 = 4 | 5 × 2 = 10 | 10 × 2 = 20 |
| 2 × 5 = 10 | 5 × 5 = 25 | 10 × 5 = 50 |

**Discovery Questions:**
- What do you notice about 2 × 5 and 10 × 1?
- If you know 5 × 4, how can you find 10 × 4?
- How are the 2× and 10× tables connected?

## Assessment for Learning: Plenary Quiz (7 minutes)

> **Teacher Script:** "Let's finish with a quick TRUE or FALSE quiz! Show me thumbs up for TRUE, thumbs down for FALSE!"

### Quiz Questions

| # | Statement | Answer | Explanation |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | If 2 × 5 = 10, then 10 ÷ 2 = 5 | ✅ TRUE | Same fact family! |
| 2 | 4 + 4 + 4 is the same as 4 × 3 | ❌ FALSE | It's 3 × 4 (three fours) |
| 3 | Double 6 equals 2 × 6 | ✅ TRUE | Double means 2 times! |
| 4 | If 15 − 5 = 10, then 10 + 5 = 15 | ✅ TRUE | Subtraction and addition are inverse! |
| 5 | 3 × 5 and 5 × 3 give different answers | ❌ FALSE | Multiplication can swap! |

### Exit Ticket (Optional)
Students write ONE fact family (4 equations) using multiplication and division before leaving.

## Teacher Notes

### Key Vocabulary
- **Fact Family** – A set of related equations using the same numbers
- **Inverse** – The opposite operation that "undoes" a calculation
- **Array** – Objects arranged in rows and columns
- **Repeated Addition** – Adding the same number multiple times
- **Double** – Two of something; multiply by 2

### Common Misconceptions to Address
1. **"3 × 4 means 3 added 4 times"** – Clarify: It means 3 groups OF 4, or 4 repeated 3 times
2. **Confusing rows and columns in arrays** – Use consistent language: "rows OF"
3. **Not recognizing inverse relationships** – Use physical "undo" demonstrations

### Cross-Curricular Links
- **Literacy:** Vocabulary building with math terms
- **Art:** Creating array patterns and designs
- **Music:** Counting beats in groups (rhythm patterns)
